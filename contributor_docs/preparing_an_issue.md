# Preparing an Issue 

Most activity on the p5.js Editor’s GitHub happens in issues. Issues are GitHub posts which can contain bug reports, feature requests, or broader discussions about the development of the p5.js Editor. It’s a great place to begin contributing.

## Filing a New Issue

To file a new issue: 

1. Visit the [Issues](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/issues) tab on the repository. 

2. Click the green 'New Issue' button on the right.

3. A modal should appear with several templates for the type of issue you would like to open. Choose the one that best matches what you're looking for (i.e Bug Report, Feature Request). 

4. Fill out the form as in-depth as you can. It helps to be as clear and specific as you can in your language and supporting information. Some ways to achieve that is by including screenshots, code snippets, or steps to exactly reproduce a scenario! Doing this helps maintainers and other contributors understand and respond to your issue more quickly and accurately.

More in-depth information about filing an issue can be found within the [p5.js Library Documentation for Issue Templates](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/contributor_docs/contributor_guidelines.md#issue-templates).

## Navigating Existing Issues

### Project Board
Many issues are related to each other and fall under bigger projects. To get a bigger picture, look at the [All Projects](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/projects/) board. 

### Searching and Filtering
If you're looking for issues to work on, a good place to start is with tickets labeled [high priority](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/labels/priority%3Ahigh). You can also look for tickets that are [feature enhancements](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/labels/type%3Afeature), [bug fixes](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/labels/type%3Abug), and a few other tags. 

If you feel like an issue is tagged incorrectly (e.g. it's low priority and you think it should be high), please update the issue!

## Understanding Issue Labels

Labels help categorize issues and makes them easier to find and sort. You can browse the full list in our [Issue Labels](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/labels), but here are a few helpful ones to understand early on:

### Good First Issues
For first-time contributors or those who want to start with a small task, [check out the list of good first issues](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/labels/good%20first%20issue), or [issues that need documentation of steps to reproduce](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22needs+steps+to+reproduce%22). It's okay to not know how to fix an issue—feel free to ask questions about to approach the problem! 

### Good Medium Issues
If you're looking for a bigger project to take on, look through the issues tagged [good medium issue](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/labels/good%20medium%20issue). These issues are self-contained projects that may take longer to work on, but are great if you're looking to get more deeply involved in contributing!

### Awaiting Maintainer Approval 
All new issues opened on the p5.js editor repository will automatically have the 'Awaiting Maintainer Approval' label. This means that the issue needs review or confirmation from a maintainer before moving forward. 

If you see an issue with this label, it's best to hold off on development until it's been approved and has the 'Ready for Work' label. 

### Ready for Work 
This label means the issue has been reviewed and is ready to be picked up! If it's not assigned to anyone yet, you can leave a comment expressing your interest and asked to be assigned. 

If you see an issue that does not have this label but you feel that it might be ready for development, feel free to comment on it!

### Help Wanted

These issues need additional input, ideas, or code contributions from the community. If you're looking to get involved, this is also a great place to start.
